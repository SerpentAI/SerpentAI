# Contributing to Serpent.AI

While the very warm and unexpected reception from the community is appreciated, Serpent.AI will, for the foreseeable future, remain a personal project of [@nbrochu](https://github.com/nbrochu). It is a labor of love with a vision and as such, the adopted stance on external contributions will be stiffer than usual.

### For this fork, however, we'll be doing things differently

[I](https://github.com/Martyn0324) also have quite some zeal towards this fork, since I've spent quite some time debugging SerpentAI, making many searches in Google and testing the code(and I'm still on it, since SerpentAI, though functional, still has some small issues).
However, all the changes I made were, all in all, small changes. One argument here, an imported module there, different library being installed over there... Since SerpentAI turned out to be very unstable(now your code works, then it doesn't), I'm very fearful about making some big changes(perhaps some lack of self confidence may help, too).

That being said, I'll be looking forward to any contribution one may desire to make to this project.

### Any unsolicited pull request will be GREATLY APPRECIATED

When making a pull request, please state why you're making your changes, try to explain how your code will work and, if possible, try to attach an example of the working code or repository that you've used for the code.

Whoever sees that code can test it out and return a feedback. I'll try testing it out, too.

If everything goes on smoothly, the pull request will be accepted.

## Contributing to the Community Wiki

While still moderated, the wiki is currently open to anyone with a GitHub account. Feel free to add tips, gotchas or even entirely new articles. Translation efforts are also extremely appreciated.

*Just, please, try not messing it all up. Having to upload the wiki backup files is boring*

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Something misbehaving? Reporting issues is a great and accessible way to improve the project for everyone.

## Help Wanted

Issues can be tagged with a special *HELP WANTED* label. This is a call to anyone in the community to participate. Pull requests addressing those will be accepted.

*If you disapprove of the above contribution policy, keep in mind that the code is totally open with a very permissive license. You are absolutely free to start your own fork, even under a different name.*
